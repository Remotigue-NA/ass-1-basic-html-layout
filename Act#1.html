            <p>Sentinels have announced the return of Tyson ‘TenZ’ Ngo to its Valorant team’s starting lineup after the player missed three weeks of action due to illness and a finger injury. TenZ played no part in the team’s last four games in VCT Americas due to illness and a finger injury. During that time, Sentinels fielded their substitute player, Jimmy ‘Marved’ Nguyen, changing some of the team’s roles to accommodate the change. The former OpTic Gaming player helped Sentinels to its first win in the league since its opening match, but the squad did not do much beyond that and currently has a 2-5 record.</p>
